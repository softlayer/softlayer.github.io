CloudLayer Computing Instances do not exist in the SoftLayer portal and returns &#39;not found&#39; exceptions in the API if the user doesn&#39;t have access to it. If a user already has access to the CloudLayer Computing Instance you&#39;re attempting to add then addVirtualGuestAccess() returns true.
Users can assign CloudLayer Computing Instance access to their child users, but not to themselves. An account&#39;s master has access to all CloudLayer Computing Instances on their customer account and can set CloudLayer Computing Instance access for any of the other users on their account.

These flags are ignored during object creation. You will need to make a subsequent call to edit object in order to enable VPN access.
An account&#39;s master user and sub-users who have the User Manage permission can add new users.
Users are created with a default permission set. After adding a user it may be helpful to set their permissions and device access.
secondaryPasswordTimeoutDays will be set to the system configured default value if the attribute is not provided or the attribute is not a valid value.
Note, neither password nor vpnPassword parameters are required.
Password When a new user is created, an email will be sent to the new user&#39;s email address with a link to a url that will allow the new user to create or change their password for the SoftLayer customer portal.
If the password parameter is provided and is not null, then that value will be validated. If it is a valid password, then the user will be created with this password.  This user will still receive a portal password email.  It can be used within 24 hours to change their password, or it can be allowed to expire, and the password provided during user creation will remain as the user&#39;s password.
If the password parameter is not provided or the value is null, the user must set their portal password using the link sent in email within 24 hours.  If the user fails to set their password within 24 hours, then a non-master user can use the &#39;Reset Password&#39; link on the login page of the portal to request a new email.  A master user can use the link to retrieve a phone number to call to assist in resetting their password.
The password parameter is ignored for VPN_ONLY users or for IBMid authenticated users.
vpnPassword If the vpnPassword is provided, then the user&#39;s vpnPassword will be set to the provided password.  When creating a vpn only user, the vpnPassword MUST be supplied.  If the vpnPassword is not provided, then the user will need to use the portal to edit their profile and set the vpnPassword.
IBMid considerations When a SoftLayer account is linked to a Platform Services (PaaS, formerly Bluemix) account, AND the trait on the SoftLayer Account indicating IBMid authentication is set, then SoftLayer will delegate the creation of an ACTIVE user to PaaS. This means that even though the request to create a new user in such an account may start at the IMS API, via this delegation we effectively turn it into a request that is driven by PaaS. In particular this means that any &#39;invitation email&#39; that comes to the user, will come from PaaS, not from IMS via IBMid.
Users created in states other than ACTIVE (for example, a VPN_ONLY user) will be created directly in IMS without delegation (but note that no invitation is sent for a user created in any state other than ACTIVE). </div>

If the user does not have the permission you&#39;re attempting to remove then removePortalPermission() returns true.
Users can assign permissions to their child users, but not to themselves. An account&#39;s master has all portal permissions and can set permissions for any of the other users on their account.
If the cascadePermissionsFlag is set to true, then removing the permission from a user will cascade down the child hierarchy and remove the permission from this user and all child users who also have the permission.
If the cascadePermissionsFlag is not set or is set to false and the user has children users who have the permission, then an exception will be thrown, and the permission will not be removed from this user.
Use the [SoftLayer_User_Customer_CustomerPermission_Permission::getAllObjects](/reference/datatypes/$1/#$2) method to retrieve a list of all permissions available in the SoftLayer customer portal and API. Permissions are removed based on the keyName property of the permission parameter. </div>

It will do this by unlinking the new owner IBMid from its current user association in this account, if there is one (note that the new owner IBMid is not required to already be a member of the IMS account). Then it will modify the existing IBMid link for the master user to use the new owner IBMid-realm IAMid. At this point, if the new owner IBMid isn&#39;t already a member of the PaaS account, it will attempt to add it. As a last step, it will call PaaS to modify the owner on that side, if necessary.  Only when all those steps are complete, it will commit the IMS-side DB changes.  Then, it will clean up the SoftLayer user that was linked to the new owner IBMid (this user became unlinked as the first step in this process).  It will also call BSS to delete the old owner IBMid. NOTE:  This method cannot be used to &#39;un-link&#39; a SoftLayer user.  Once linked, a SoftLayer user can never be un-linked.
