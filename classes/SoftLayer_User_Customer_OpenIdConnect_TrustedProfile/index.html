If the cascadeFlag is set to false, then an exception will be thrown if the new parent does not have all of the permissions that this user possesses.  If the cascadeFlag is set to true, then permissions will be removed from this user and the descendants of this user as necessary so that no children of the parent will have permissions that the parent does not possess.

If the cascadePermissionsFlag is set to true, then removing the permission from a user will cascade down the child hierarchy and remove the permission from this user and all child users who also have the permission.
If the cascadePermissionsFlag is not set or is set to false and the user has children users who have the permission, then an exception will be thrown, and the permission will not be removed from this user.

It will do this by unlinking the new owner IBMid from its current user association in this account, if there is one (note that the new owner IBMid is not required to already be a member of the IMS account). Then it will modify the existing IBMid link for the master user to use the new owner IBMid-realm IAMid. At this point, if the new owner IBMid isn&#39;t already a member of the PaaS account, it will attempt to add it. As a last step, it will call PaaS to modify the owner on that side, if necessary.  Only when all those steps are complete, it will commit the IMS-side DB changes.  Then, it will clean up the SoftLayer user that was linked to the new owner IBMid (this user became unlinked as the first step in this process).  It will also call BSS to delete the old owner IBMid.
