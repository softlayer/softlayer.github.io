      <description>When querying the SoftLayer API and using a resultLimit to paginate your results, you should almost always use an OrderBy objectFilter to sort your results, as by default most results will not have an order imposed on them by the database. It is fairly common for the database to have differeing orders between queries UNLESS an OrderBy filter is used.&#xA;The python client itself has a built in function called iter_call which will return a python generator.</description>
