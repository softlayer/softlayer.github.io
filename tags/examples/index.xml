      <description>Basic of Threads If you are unfamiliar with Threads, these examples will use the concurrent.futures library within python (available after python3.2) which is fairly simple to get setup. I wont really go over HOW it works on a technical level, only how to best use it threads to improve performance when making SoftLayer API requests.&#xA;For some technical details on how python handles Threads the following are good reading on the topic</description>

      <title>Golang Example Framework</title>

      <description>The framework for new golang examples will be a simple CLI application that you can copy / paste in commands individually as needed to hopefully help better understand how to work with the data returned from the SoftLayer API in a practicle manner.&#xA;To do all this, we first need to setup a basic framework project to add these commands into. We will be using the Cobra CLI framework for golang, letting us create an individual command for each example as we go along.</description>

      <description>/* Get information about account This is an example gets SoftLayer_Account information without using softlayer-go client. On this case we will build a SoftLayerServiceRequest object which contains information about service we want to send a request, this will be passed to UrlRequest() method to build the url of service and finally we will make the request by using the method RestRequest(). Additionally we will show how to save the response data in an structure called &amp;#39;Struct&amp;#39;.</description>
