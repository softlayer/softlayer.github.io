                            <div class="meta">The SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice service controls the invoices that are created whenever a SoftLayer customer&#39;s account balance changes. Invoices exist in the following states: *&#39;&#39;&#39;OPEN&#39;&#39;&#39;: Invoices which have not been paid yet. Invoices are created in the OPEN state. *&#39;&#39;&#39;CLOSED&#39;&#39;&#39;: Invoices that SoftLayer has received payment for. *&#39;&#39;&#39;CLOSED_FAILED&#39;&#39;&#39;: Invoices which were closed but were not paid for. Customers who are terminated for non-payment typically have invoices in this state.

Once an invoice is paid it moves from OPEN to CLOSED state. Invoices are created under varying types, which are defined in the type property of the [SoftLayer_Invoice](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Invoice). Invoices are created under one of the following type categories: *&#39;&#39;&#39;NEW&#39;&#39;&#39;: An invoice for new service. A SoftLayer customer&#39;s first invoice is of the NEW type. *&#39;&#39;&#39;RECURRING&#39;&#39;&#39;: Invoices that are generated on a SoftLayer customer&#39;s anniversary billing date for monthly services. *&#39;&#39;&#39;ONE-TIME-CHARGE&#39;&#39;&#39;: Invoices that are generated when one-time charges are applied to an account for fees incurred from products or services procured outside of the standard purchasing processes. *&#39;&#39;&#39;CREDIT&#39;&#39;&#39;: Invoices that are generated whenever SoftLayer applies a credit against an account&#39;s balance. *&#39;&#39;&#39;REFUND&#39;&#39;&#39;: Account credits that are applied against a customer&#39;s account balance along with the receivables on their account. REFUND type invoices are generated whenever a customer receives a service credit on their account balance and has their invoice items changed due to the credit. *&#39;&#39;&#39;MANUAL_PAYMENT_CREDIT&#39;&#39;&#39;: Invoice credits that are generated whenever a customer makes a manual payment.

Invoices are created with contact information duplicated from the [SoftLayer_Account](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Account). We do this in order to maintain a history of an account&#39;s contact information as invoices are generated. Likewise each invoice record keeps track of an account&#39;s balance as the invoice is opened and closed.

Billing items range from server chassis to hard drives to control panels, bandwidth quota upgrades and port upgrade charges. Softlayer [SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice) are generated from the cost of a customer&#39;s billing items. Billing items are copied from the product catalog as they&#39;re ordered by customers to create a reference between an account and the billable items they own.
Billing items exist in a tree relationship. Items are associated with each other by parent/child relationships. Component items such as CPU&#39;s, RAM, and software each have a parent billing item for the server chassis they&#39;re associated with. Billing Items with a null parent item do not have an associated parent item. </div>

The SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecords service also controls the records contained in reverse DNS records. SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_Reverse records contain multiple PTR type resource records.
As with domain changes, resource record changes happen immediately, but may take up to 72 hours to propagate to the rest of the Internet&#39;s name servers. The SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord service only applies to domains hosted on the SoftLayer name servers. </div>

This is accomplished through the use of zone transfers. Each record created within the secondary DNS service defines which zone is transferred, what server it is transferred from, and the frequency that zone transfers occur at. Zone transfers are performed automatically based on the transfer frequency set on the secondary DNS record. Domains created via zone transfer may not be modified by the SoftLayer portal or API.
The secondary DNS service also provides the ability to manually initiate a zone transfer through the [SoftLayer_Dns_Secondary::transferNow](/reference/datatypes/$1/#$2) method. The daemon that performs zone transfers runs once a minute, therefore it could take a full minute for the zone transfer to be completed.
Secondary DNS transfers may periodically generate notification or error messages. Please use the [SoftLayer_Dns_Message](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Dns_Message) service to retrieve these notifications. </div>

Load balancing is accomplished similarly to SoftLayer&#39;s other load balancer options, through a collection of virtual IP address interfaces.
Application delivery controllers support an &#39;advanced&#39; configuration scheme, enabling access directly to the controller&#39;s backend management interface. Enable access to this interface via the [SoftLayer_Network_Application_Delivery_Controller::enableAdvancedView](/reference/datatypes/$1/#$2) method in this service. Use the username &#39;root&#39; and password retrieved from this service along with the management IP address retrieved from this service. Be warned that direct access to the application delivery controller exposes a high degree of functionality. Be careful when directly editing your service to avoid interruption via misconfiguration. </div>

Virtual Private Rack Each server is by default a part of your Virtual Private Rack. Bandwidth overages are billed individually per server for all hardware in your Virtual Private Rack. If any one server uses more bandwidth than it is allocated, an overage charge will result.
Bandwidth Pooling Bandwidth Pooling allow you to optimize your bandwidth usage by &#39;pooling&#39; all of the bandwidth together for servers in a Bandwidth Pooling. Bandwidth overages for servers in a Bandwidth Pooling are summed up as a whole and overages are calculated only if the total bandwidth of all servers exceeds the total allocated bandwidth for all servers.
For example, if you had 5 servers, each with 2000 GB of bandwidth, and one server used 3000 GB of bandwidth while the other used only 1500 GB of bandwidth, you would not be billed for an overage because your total usage would be 9000 GB and your total allocated would be 10000 GB. </div>

The most common use case of a load balancer instance is to improve performance and high availability of customers application services by distributing the incoming requests across multiple servers. Thus, clients using customers application services will only need to know the load balancer instances host name respective IP address in order to submit their requests. Note that SoftLayer_Network_LBaaS_LoadBalancer provides the load balancing functionality only, while it is customers responsibility to implement their application services and deploy them to respective servers, typically virtual servers or bare metal systems hosted by IBM SoftLayer. Conceptually a load balancer instance consists of a set of listeners, also called frontends, pools, also called backends, and members (application servers). A listener (frontend) represents basically the network protocol and port for requests coming from clients applications and is always associated with a pool (backend) defined by a network protocol, port and load balancing algorithm. The pools network protocol and port specify how incoming requests will be forwarded to application servers, while the load balancing algorithm (round-robin, weighted round-robin or least connections) determines the distribution scheme of incoming requests among the members, ie application servers. Note that members of a load balancer instance are assigned implicitly to all pools (backends) of that load balancer. </div>

A global load balancer account enables you to load balance traffic between servers that are in geographically diverse locations.  SoftLayer&#39;s global load balancers act as a highly modified DNS server.  SoftLayer&#39;s global load balancers work by accepting DNS requests for a specific hostname, choosing a host from a load balancing pool using the load balance method specified, and returning a destination IP address through a DNS response. </div>

                            <div class="meta">Load balancer services represent the &#39;routes&#39; that the load balancer will have available to route requests. Each service has a source port (located on the load balancer itself), and a destination IP address and port. Any services that share a source port will be used as potential routes for traffic coming into the load balancer on that port.  For instance, if there are two services that both have a source port of 80, both of those services will be used as balanced servers for traffic coming into your virtual IP on port 80.  For a more complete example, consider the following scenario:

:Virtual IP Address:  123.123.123.123 :Servers on your account: :12.34.56.78 :23.45.67.89 :You want to set up both HTTP(port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) on each of those servers. :You will need four services:

{| |- ! SourcePort ! DestinationIpAddress ! DestinationPort |- | 80 | 12.34.56.78 | 80 |- | 80 | 23.45.67.89 | 80 |- | 443 | 12.34.56.78 | 443 |- | 443 | 23.45.67.89 | 443 |}

The services also have a routing type, these ALSO need to be the same for services that share the same port. For this example, the services with a source port of 80 should have HTTP as their type.  The other two services should have TCP as their type.

For example, if you have a Windows Media Video file you wish to stream in Flash Video format, transcoding would be the process to make this change. Individual SoftLayer customer can have a single Transcode account and you need to create a Transcode account to use the service. To create a Transcode account, go to the &#39;Private Network&#39; -&gt; &#39;Transcoding&#39; page in the SoftLayer [https://manage.softlayer.com customer portal] or invoke [SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Account::createTranscodeAccount](/reference/datatypes/$1/#$2) method.
SoftLayer Transcoding service supports a large number of video and audio codecs. This means you can transcode many different types of movies.  Refer to [http://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/questions/409/SoftLayer&#43;Transcoding&#43;FAQ Transcode FAQ] for supported codes and media containers. Transcode server also has hundreds of pre-defined output formats that you can choose from.
A Transcode account object allows you to communicate with the Transcode FTP (transcode.service.softlayer.com server) server and Transcode server. You can retrieve a directory listing, details on a media file, Transcode output presets, and Transcode FTP login credentials. Most importantly, you can create transcode jobs through your Transcode account.
When a Transcode account is created, it creates an FTP account on the Transcode FTP. You can upload your media files to the /in directory and you can download transcoded media files from the /out directory. You can keep the files 3 days from the creation date. They will be automatically deleted after this point. For more details on the Transcode FTP server, refer to [SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Account::getFtpAttributes](/reference/datatypes/$1/#$2) method. </div>

A vulnerability scan attempts to find potential security problems on a server by first searching for open ports and the services that run on them.  If any services are found the scanner will then check for version and patch information of each service found.  Lastly, the scanner will use the information gathered to search its database of known vulnerabilities and generate a report. Reports typically take five to ten minutes to run but allow for up to thirty minutes in rare cases.
A vulnerability report will typically include the following information: *Number of security holes and warnings. *The hosts that were scanned. *The port/service and the corresponding issue. *Detailed information about the issue, risk factor, and possible fixes.

If you have a firewall, SoftLayer&#39;s administrative networks need to be allowed for the vulnerability scan to be effective.  If a firewall is blocking all ports, the report may not show any problems even if some exist.  In addition you may have some indication in your firewall logs of the scan taking place as ports on your system are investigated. </div>

This service provides the entry point for placing orders and quotes with SoftLayer. To place orders using these services, you must provide the appropriate container type as defined by [SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order). For server orders, you would use [SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_Hardware_Server](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_Hardware_Server). For virtual server orders, you would use [SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_Virtual_Guest](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_Virtual_Guest). For additional service orders, it will depend on the additional service (e.g., network attached storage, object storage) being purchased. See the data types documentation to get a list of all the available container types beginning with `SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_*`.
There are several main entry points associated with ordering:
- [SoftLayer_Product_Order::placeOrder](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Order/placeOrder) Order servers and services. Your credit card or PayPal account will get charged when successfully placed.
- [SoftLayer_Product_Order::verifyOrder](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Order/verifyOrder) Run verification on your order before it&#39;s actually placed to get additional information, like your total monthly or hourly recurring charges. You may also call this service to help ensure that your call to [SoftLayer_Product_Order::placeOrder](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Order/placeOrder) will succeed. **This service is called internally, so it is not required to verify before you call `placeOrder`.** No credit card or PayPal charges result from this call.
- [SoftLayer_Product_Order::placeQuote](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Order/placeQuote) Create a quote only. Subsequent orders may be placed from this quote. See [SoftLayer_Billing_Order_Quote::placeOrder](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Order_Quote/placeOrder) for details on how to order from a quote.
- [SoftLayer_Product_Order::getVlans](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Order/getVlans) Get a list of available VLANs that can be supplied when placing an order.
While this service provides detailed customization for ordering, some customers may find the simplified ordering system sufficient for their needs. For more information, see the following:

Once the certificate authority (CA) approves your order, the status will change to &#39;Approved&#39;. Once your order is approved, you will receive your fulfillment email from the CA. The email will contain your SSL certificate. SoftLayer does not store your SSL certificate in our system. If you lose the email from your CA, you can have the fulfillment email sent again via the SoftLayer customer portal or by using [SoftLayer_Security_Certificate_Request::resendEmail](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Security_Certificate_Request/resendEmail). Your approved order will be picked up by SoftLayer&#39;s billing system and it will complete the payment process. Finally, your order will change to &#39;Complete&#39; status when the payment process is successful.
There might be a chance that your SSL certificate order could rejected by a CA. Our automated system will put a rejected order into &#39;Canceled&#39; status. You can contact SoftLayer Support for more details. </div>

                            <div class="meta">Tickets are SoftLayer&#39;s primary way to keep in touch with its customers. A ticket is an entity that describes a problem or request and tracks a conversation between you, your account users, and SoftLayer employees relating to your problem or request. Tickets can be assigned to one of your account users, and SoftLayer can assign a ticket to a particular department (also called a ticket group) or employee. The SoftLayer_Ticket service controls your interaction with SoftLayer&#39;s ticketing system.
Every ticket object has at least one ticket update. Ticket updates may be created by either a user or SoftLayer employee. These ticket updates record the conversation between SoftLayer and you about the issue at hand. You may only add new updates to a ticket. Once an update is created you may not edit or delete it.
Tickets exist in one of three states: open, assigned, and closed. Open tickets are considered a current issue, but are not yet assigned to a specific SoftLayer employee. Assigned issues are open issues that are assigned to a SoftLayer employee. You can safely assume that your ticket is being handled if it is in the Assigned state. Closed tickets are considered resolved issues and allow no further updates. Please contact SoftLayer if you need to re-open a ticket, as you may only create ticket updates on open or assigned tickets.
It is possible to attach files and associate hardware with a ticket. Associating your ticket with more than one pieces of hardware helps SoftLayer&#39;s support team localize issues to certain servers. Attachments are a good way to illustrate a point, such as adding a screen shot of a problem or attaching a driver or configuration file that you&#39;d like investigated.
Typically the only tickets an account user may create are technical support tickets. Technical support tickets are divided into two categories: standard tickets and administrative tickets. A standard support ticket describes an issue with your SoftLayer server or services. Standard support tickets&#39; titles must be selected from a pre-determined list of ticket subjects, defined in the [SoftLayer_Ticket_Subject](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Ticket_Subject) service. If you need a little help from SoftLayer&#39;s support staff to manage your server then open an administrative support ticket. Administrative tickets add a one-time $3USD charge to your account, and you may specify your ticket&#39;s title as needed. </div>

                            <div class="meta">The SoftLayer_User_Permission_Action class is one of several classes that make up the customer permission system.  The system is a role-based system that includes defined actions which can be grouped together using a SoftLayer_User_Permission_Group.  These groups of actions are then used to define roles, and the roles are assigned to users.
When a [SoftLayer_User_Customer](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_User_Customer) is created, a SoftLayer_User_Permission_Group and SoftLayer_User_Permission_Role is created specifically for the user with a group type of SYSTEM.  When the UI is used to alter the permissions of a customer user, the actions are added or removed from this group.  The api can not be used to alter the permissions in this group.  If an account wants to create their own unique permission groups and roles, the UI can not be used to manage them.
User Customers can be assigned to multiple roles but it is recommended to either use the UI for managing account users permissions or only use the api.  Mixing the two will lead to confusing results as the UI will not show any permissions assigned to a user via a customer created role/group combination.
Proceed with caution.
The SoftLayer_User_Permission_Action class defines the permissions that are required in order for a SoftLayer_User_Customer to perform certain actions within IMS.
