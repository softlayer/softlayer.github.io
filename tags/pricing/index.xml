      <description>Order a Bare Metal by frondend/backend vlan or router. Find the package that you want to order. listServerPackages() will filter out all that are not bare metal servers.&#xA;Use getServerPrices() to find the item keyNames you want to include in your order. These price IDs can be included prices array directly, but I’ve included gatherPriceIds() to match up KeyNames to build a list of price ids. getServerPrices() will also show the locations available for ordering.</description>

      <description>Version 5.4.0 of the Softlayer-python project introducted some managers and CLI functions that greatly simplify the ordering processes via the api.&#xA;Building a package still requires a few steps however.&#xA;1. Find the package name slcli order package-list The most common packages are the following:&#xA;Description Package KeyName Package Type Additional Products ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS ADDITIONAL_SERVICES Cloud Server CLOUD_SERVER VIRTUAL_SERVER_INSTANCE Network Gateway Appliance NETWORK_GATEWAY_APPLIANCE BARE_METAL_GATEWAY Load Balancers LOAD_BALANCERS ADDITIONAL_SERVICES_LOAD_BALANCER Bare Metal Server BARE_METAL_SERVER BARE_METAL_CPU_FAST_PROVISION POWER8 TULETA IBM_POWER_8 BARE_METAL_POWER_CPU Object Storage OBJECT_STORAGE ADDITIONAL_SERVICES_OBJECT_STORAGE Firewall FIREWALL ADDITIONAL_SERVICES_FIREWALL Storage As A Service (StaaS) STORAGE_AS_A_SERVICE_STAAS STORAGE_AS_A_SERVICE Load Balancer As A Service (LBaaS) LBAAS LOAD_BALANCER_AS_A_SERVICE Dedicated Host DEDICATED_HOST DEDICATED_HOST Public Virtual Server PUBLIC_CLOUD_SERVER VIRTUAL_SERVER_INSTANCE Once we have selected a package we need to find out where we can order this package.</description>

      <title>Find Location specific pricing for a package</title>

      <description>With the introduction to Location-based Pricing, we updated our pricing model to represent the costs in each data center more clearly. Instead of adding premiums to a base server price, we have priced servers and services in each data center with their own location-based SoftLayer_Product_Item_Price objects via the API. In the following example we will query for the Dallas 10 data center for SoftLayer Virtual Guests.&#xA;require &amp;#39;softlayer_api&amp;#39; require &amp;#39;pp&amp;#39; client = SoftLayer::Client.</description>

Instead of adding premiums to a base server price, we have priced servers and services in each data center with their own location-based SoftLayer_Product_Item_Price objects via the API. The following example shows how to get the Standard priceItemId for a package regardless of the location.&#xA;&amp;lt;?php require_once &amp;#39;./vendor/autoload.php&amp;#39;; $apiUsername = getenv(&amp;#39;SOFTLAYER_USERNAME&amp;#39;); $apiKey = getenv(&amp;#39;SOFTLAYER_API_KEY&amp;#39;); $packageId = 194; try { $client = \SoftLayer\SoapClient::getClient(&amp;#39;SoftLayer_Product_Package&amp;#39;, $packageId, $apiUsername, $apiKey); $filter = new stdClass(); $filter-&amp;gt;items = new stdClass(); $filter-&amp;gt;items-&amp;gt;prices = new stdClass(); $filter-&amp;gt;items-&amp;gt;prices-&amp;gt;locationGroupId = new stdClass(); $filter-&amp;gt;items-&amp;gt;prices-&amp;gt;locationGroupId-&amp;gt;operation = &amp;#39;is null&amp;#39;; $client-&amp;gt;setObjectFilter($filter); $standardPricing = $client-&amp;gt;getItems(); print_r($standardPricing); } catch (\Exception $e) { die(&amp;#39;Cannot compute.</description>

Instead of adding premiums to a base server price, we have priced servers and services in each data center with their own location-based SoftLayer_Product_Item_Price objects via the API. In the following example we will query for the Dallas 6 data center, and then filter our item (Local Load Balancer) and prices to include only the location-based pricing for the specific data center we&amp;rsquo;re in —or we can filter for the standard price if a location-based price doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.</description>
