      <description>Quotes Quotes are a way to save an order, and then easily duplicate the order later. You can create a quote from the control portal by going through the normal order process, and then instead of hitting &amp;ldquo;Order&amp;rdquo; at the end, there will be a button that says &amp;ldquo;Save Quote&amp;rdquo;, which will save the order for later. You can then use the quote service to pull down the information about it from the API.</description>

      <description>The SoftLayer platform lets you add dynamic data and scripts when you place your order. The scripts are executed after the machine is booted.&#xA;To place a script on a virtual server, the script must be available through a URL.&#xA;Note: For HTTP URLs, the script is injected in the server and manually executed. For HTTPS URLs, the script is injected and automatically executed.&#xA;In this article, we use https://x.x.x.x/ as the URL where the scripts are available and time.</description>
