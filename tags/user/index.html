Users can assign hardware access to their child users, but not to themselves. An account&#39;s master has access to all hardware on their customer account and can set hardware access for any of the other users on their account. </div>

These flags are ignored during object creation. You will need to make a subsequent call to edit object in order to enable VPN access.
An account&#39;s master user and sub-users who have the User Manage permission can add new users.
Users are created with a default permission set. After adding a user it may be helpful to set their permissions and device access.
secondaryPasswordTimeoutDays will be set to the system configured default value if the attribute is not provided or the attribute is not a valid value.
Note, neither password nor vpnPassword parameters are required.
Password When a new user is created, an email will be sent to the new user&#39;s email address with a link to a url that will allow the new user to create or change their password for the SoftLayer customer portal.
If the password parameter is provided and is not null, then that value will be validated. If it is a valid password, then the user will be created with this password.  This user will still receive a portal password email.  It can be used within 24 hours to change their password, or it can be allowed to expire, and the password provided during user creation will remain as the user&#39;s password.
If the password parameter is not provided or the value is null, the user must set their portal password using the link sent in email within 24 hours.  If the user fails to set their password within 24 hours, then a non-master user can use the &#39;Reset Password&#39; link on the login page of the portal to request a new email.  A master user can use the link to retrieve a phone number to call to assist in resetting their password.
The password parameter is ignored for VPN_ONLY users or for IBMid authenticated users.
vpnPassword If the vpnPassword is provided, then the user&#39;s vpnPassword will be set to the provided password.  When creating a vpn only user, the vpnPassword MUST be supplied.  If the vpnPassword is not provided, then the user will need to use the portal to edit their profile and set the vpnPassword.
IBMid considerations When a SoftLayer account is linked to a Platform Services (PaaS, formerly Bluemix) account, AND the trait on the SoftLayer Account indicating IBMid authentication is set, then SoftLayer will delegate the creation of an ACTIVE user to PaaS. This means that even though the request to create a new user in such an account may start at the IMS API, via this delegation we effectively turn it into a request that is driven by PaaS. In particular this means that any &#39;invitation email&#39; that comes to the user, will come from PaaS, not from IMS via IBMid.
Users created in states other than ACTIVE (for example, a VPN_ONLY user) will be created directly in IMS without delegation (but note that no invitation is sent for a user created in any state other than ACTIVE). </div>

                            <div class="meta">Create a new user in the SoftLayer customer portal. It is not possible to set up SLL enable flags during object creation. These flags are ignored during object creation. You will need to make a subsequent call to edit object in order to enable VPN access.
An account&#39;s master user and sub-users who have the User Manage permission can add new users.
Users are created with a default permission set. After adding a user it may be helpful to set their permissions and device access.
secondaryPasswordTimeoutDays will be set to the system configured default value if the attribute is not provided or the attribute is not a valid value.
Note, neither password nor vpnPassword parameters are required.
Password When a new user is created, an email will be sent to the new user&#39;s email address with a link to a url that will allow the new user to create or change their password for the SoftLayer customer portal.
If the password parameter is provided and is not null, then that value will be validated. If it is a valid password, then the user will be created with this password.  This user will still receive a portal password email.  It can be used within 24 hours to change their password, or it can be allowed to expire, and the password provided during user creation will remain as the user&#39;s password.
If the password parameter is not provided or the value is null, the user must set their portal password using the link sent in email within 24 hours.  If the user fails to set their password within 24 hours, then a non-master user can use the &#39;Reset Password&#39; link on the login page of the portal to request a new email.  A master user can use the link to retrieve a phone number to call to assist in resetting their password.
The password parameter is ignored for VPN_ONLY users or for IBMid authenticated users.
vpnPassword If the vpnPassword is provided, then the user&#39;s vpnPassword will be set to the provided password.  When creating a vpn only user, the vpnPassword MUST be supplied.  If the vpnPassword is not provided, then the user will need to use the portal to edit their profile and set the vpnPassword.
IBMid considerations When a SoftLayer account is linked to a Platform Services (PaaS, formerly Bluemix) account, AND the trait on the SoftLayer Account indicating IBMid authentication is set, then SoftLayer will delegate the creation of an ACTIVE user to PaaS. This means that even though the request to create a new user in such an account may start at the IMS API, via this delegation we effectively turn it into a request that is driven by PaaS. In particular this means that any &#39;invitation email&#39; that comes to the user, will come from PaaS, not from IMS via IBMid.
Users created in states other than ACTIVE (for example, a VPN_ONLY user) will be created directly in IMS without delegation (but note that no invitation is sent for a user created in any state other than ACTIVE). </div>

Child users inherit the properties and permissions of their parent user while conversely a user may have more than one child users.
API users have full access to their own portal user account and they could also have access to other users under their SoftLayer customer account, if they have &#39;Manage Users&#39; permission in the customer portal.
There are two relational properties that contain the permissions assigned to a customer user; permissions and actions.  These are simply two different representations of the same information. The permissions ORM key creates a SoftLayer_Container_Collection_Permissions collection from SoftLayer_User_Customer_CustomerPermission_Permission objects which is populated from the same data source as the actions ORM key which creates a SoftLayer_Container_Collection_Permissions collection from SoftLayer_User_Permission_Action objects. </div>

Status differs from user permissions in that user status applies globally to the portal while user permissions are applied to specific portal functions.
Note that a status of &#39;PENDING&#39; also has been added. This status is specific to users that are configured to use IBMid authentication. This would include some (not all) users on accounts that are linked to Platform Services (PaaS, formerly Bluemix) accounts, but is not limited to users in such accounts. Using IBMid authentication is optional for active users even if it is not required by the account type. PENDING status indicates that a relationship between an IBMid and a user is being set up but is not complete. To be complete, PENDING users need to perform an action (&#39;accepting the invitation&#39;) before becoming an active user within IBM Cloud and/or IMS. PENDING is a system state, and can not be administered by users (including the account master user). SoftLayer Commercial is the only environment where IBMid and/or account linking are used.

                            <div class="meta">The SoftLayer_User_Permission_Action class is one of several classes that make up the customer permission system.  The system is a role-based system that includes defined actions which can be grouped together using a SoftLayer_User_Permission_Group.  These groups of actions are then used to define roles, and the roles are assigned to users.
When a [SoftLayer_User_Customer](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_User_Customer) is created, a SoftLayer_User_Permission_Group and SoftLayer_User_Permission_Role is created specifically for the user with a group type of SYSTEM.  When the UI is used to alter the permissions of a customer user, the actions are added or removed from this group.  The api can not be used to alter the permissions in this group.  If an account wants to create their own unique permission groups and roles, the UI can not be used to manage them.
User Customers can be assigned to multiple roles but it is recommended to either use the UI for managing account users permissions or only use the api.

It is a role-based system that includes defined actions which can be &#39;grouped&#39; together using a SoftLayer_User_Permission_Group class. These groups of actions are then used to define roles, and the roles are assigned to users.  The SoftLayer_User_Permission_Group is also used to track the resources or account devices to which a user has been granted access. The types of resources that users can be granted access is defined in [SoftLayer_User_Permission_Resource_Type](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_User_Permission_Resource_Type).
When a [SoftLayer_User_Customer](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_User_Customer) is created, a SoftLayer_User_Permission_Group and SoftLayer_User_Permission_Role is created specifically for the user with a group type of SYSTEM.  When the UI is used to alter the permissions of a customer user, the actions are added or removed from this group.  The api can not be used to alter the permissions in this group.  If an account wants to create their own unique permission groups and roles, the UI can not be used to manage them.
This is also true for device access.  Either, the UI can be used to track the devices to which users are granted access which will use the SYSTEM group, or the api can be used, making the UI information inaccurate.
User Customers can be assigned to multiple roles but it is recommended to either use the UI for managing account users permissions or only use the api.  Mixing the two will lead to confusing results as the UI will not show any permissions assigned to a user via a customer created role/group combination.

You can provide an array of [SoftLayer_Container_User_Data_Phone](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Container_User_Data_Phone) objects. You have to mark one as the primary phone number by setting &#39;phoneType&#39; to &#39;PRIMARY&#39;.

*countryCode: Country code number for the phone number. Default: 1 (United States &amp; Canada &#43;1) *phone: Phone number that 2 Form Factor system will call or text for user authentication. The phone number format must match the format selected in the Country Code. *extension: Specify the extension that will be dialed after the call is answered. Digits, commas, *, and # are allowed.  Commas can be used for a one second pause to navigate phone system menus. *phoneType: Specify the primary and backup phone number by setting this value to &#39;PRIMARY&#39; or &#39;BACKUP&#39;. If omitted, it will be considered to be the primary phone number. If you are passing two Phone objects, you must specify the phone type of each phone number.
