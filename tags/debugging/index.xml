      <title>Deprecation</title>

      <description>As of the publication of this article, SLDN will now highlight areas of the API that are deprecated in red. These features still exist, but will usually not actually do anything, and will be removed in a future version of the API.&#xA;Deprecated features will usually still return the same type of data, but with a placeholder values instead of valid data. For example a property that returned an array of objects might now just return an empty array ([]), or a boolean might just return false at all times now.</description>

      <title>Exception Handling in the SoftLayer API</title>

      <description>Like any programming interface the SoftLayer API at times needs to return error messages to its users. The SoftLayer API brings these exceptions forward to the user so their application can handle the unexpected result. Exceptions are returned as SOAP, REST, or XML-RPC faults depending on the RPC method used to execute your API method call. Programming and scripting languages with SOAP and XML-RPC support usually have built-in methods for handling faults.</description>

      <title>Legacy Object Masks</title>

      <description>Table of contents&amp;nbsp; Structure Creating an Object Mask Referenced API Components Services Data Types Internal Links Most of the data types modeled in the SoftLayer API contain relational properties that tie one data type to another. For instance, a SoftLayer_Account has links to its domains, support tickets, hardware, users, and much more. By default, calling the [[SoftLayer_Account]] service&#39;s getObject method won&#39;t retrieve relational and count properties. In order to retrieve this information, you would have to call getUsers, getTickets, and other methods.</description>
