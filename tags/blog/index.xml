      <description>Load Balancing is a way to distribute processing and communications evenly across multiple servers within a data center so that a single device does not carry an entire load. SoftLayer Load Balancing enables customers to employ a variety of balancing methods to distribute traffic, including persistent and non-persistent options, that can be changed, activated and deactivated at any time. Today we are going to look at how to use the Python slcli client to manage your SoftLayer Local Load balancers.</description>

      <description>The ability to order bare metal servers is one of the unique advantages of the SoftLayer cloud. But bare metal servers are inherently more complicated than virtual server infrastructures (VSI) because there are many more choices. A subset of the common bare metal servers can be ordered fairly easily using the [[SoftLayer_Hardware::createObject()]] method. If that’s sufficient for you, you can stop reading this article right here. If you only need to order one type of custom bare metal server, you don&amp;rsquo;t need most of the detail that follows.</description>

      <description>When we launch a new data center, we try to keep everything as consistent as possible between locations. We use the same hardware, we have a skilled “Go Live” team to bring everything online, and we train our local operations staff the same way. When we open a new data center in Dallas, that’s easy. But when the new facility is on the other side of the planet, things can get a little more complicated.</description>

      <description>The SoftLayer REST API is powerful and convenient because you can use it from any language or no language (the command line or browser). The basics of using the REST API are explained in an SLDN article on REST, and some examples are given in an SLDN blog post on REST. But even with this good information, it can be a little confusing understanding how to map what you see in the SoftLayer API Services and Data Reference to the exact REST API invocation that should be made.</description>

      <description>If you have ever used a canary build of the Ember.js framework, you are likely familiar with feature flags. Used to bundle functionality and make it available in an application, it also allows for its use to be turned on or off via an entry in the application’s configuration file. While used by the Ember.js community to allow for an easy way to test new, and sometimes experimental, features in upcoming releases of Ember.</description>

      <description>In my first two blog posts in this series, Part 1 and Part 2, I covered many general aspects of how to use the SoftLayer API effectively. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into how to order SoftLayer resources using the SoftLayer API. [For ordering virtual servers, read Simplified CCI Creation for a great explanation of the simplified virtual server ordering process.]&#xA;Understanding How to Order SoftLayer Resources First, it is probably obvious, but to order a resource means to begin renting it, and to cancel a resource means to stop renting it.</description>

In this post, I&#39;ll cover additional aspects of using the SoftLayer API with the python client. List of Services to Start Navigating From If you read part 1 of the series, you have a lot of good techniques for querying the data of resources in SoftLayer such that from any service you can efficiently follow the data trail to other services to get to all of the information you want.</description>

      <description>So you want to code to the SoftLayer API, your language of choice is python (well done), and you’ve read the SoftLayer API Overview on the SLDN site. You&amp;rsquo;ve even read the article using the SoftLayer API from python, but it just felt like a tease. So you follow the web trail to readthedocs for the slightly longer API Documentation. You think, “maybe that’s all I need to know.” You dive in and start your first program.</description>

      <description>In the context of the SoftLayer API, SoftLayer CloudLayer Computing Instances(CCIs) are represented by SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest objects. The SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest service allows for interaction with a specific CCI and you are able to interact with all CCIs on your account through the SoftLayer_Account service.&#xA;Creating Ordering new CCIs is accomplished through SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest::createObject.&#xA;First, a SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest template object is created that contains the details of the CCI. Every CCI template object will need, at minimum, the following properties defined:</description>

      <description>The SoftLayer platform lets you add dynamic data and scripts when you place your order. The scripts are executed after the machine is booted.&#xA;To place a script on a virtual server, the script must be available through a URL.&#xA;Note: For HTTP URLs, the script is injected in the server and manually executed. For HTTPS URLs, the script is injected and automatically executed.&#xA;In this article, we use https://x.x.x.x/ as the URL where the scripts are available and time.</description>

      <description>DevOps adoption rate has substantially increased in the last couple of years across all organization sizes due to the real business value that DevOps provides in terms of agility. Automation of application installation in the cloud is an important aspect in DevOps. Traditionally, automation has been achieved via writing shell scripts. These were sufficient to manage smaller applications, but more complex runtimes required the scripts to be written in higher-level programming languages like Perl, Python and Ruby.</description>

      <description>A common problem when developing controller functionality is how to structure the workflow of the page. You have to make sure that the different scenarios are accounted for and make sense to the end user, but you also want to make sure that your code stays neat and easy to maintain. A good solution to this common problem is to break up your functionality into two discrete categories and use header redirection to navigate between controller actions that only belong to one category or the other.</description>

      <description>According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, debt is defined as, &#34;something owed, an obligation, to be in a state of owing.&#34; You are likely familiar with this concept as it pertains to financial affairs. When you take out a loan to purchase a home or vehicle, you have obligated yourself to repay the amount of money you borrowed from a financial institution. If you do not fulfill your repayment obligation there are consequences, most likely the repossession of the item purchased with the borrowed funds and a decrease in your credit worthiness.</description>

The &#34;M&#34; in MVC stands for model which is the most important layer in an application, for if the data models are not correctly architected anything built on top of them will inherit their deficiencies. While this post is not going to discuss how to architect your data models in Ember.</description>

      <description>Users interact with SoftLayer&#39;s authortative DNS servers through the SoftLayer_Dns_Domain service. Each SoftLayer_Dns_Domain has a collection of SoftLayer_DNS_Domain_ResourceRecords referenced by the resourceRecords relational property. While it is possible to interact with resource records through the SoftLayer_Dns_Domain service, it is best to use the SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord service directly after initial zone creation.&#xA;Domains Listing A list of all domains currently hosted on the SoftLayer nameservers can be retrieved with SoftLayer_Account::getDomains which returnr an array of SoftLayer_Dns_Domain template objects.</description>

      <description>In the context of the SoftLayer API, SoftLayer Virtual Server Instances(VSIs) are represented by [[SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest (type)]] objects. The [[SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest]] service allows for interaction with a specific VSI and you are able to interact with all VSIs on your account through the [[SoftLayer_Account]] service. You will want to make sure you are on the latest version of the Softlayer PHP API SoapClient.&#xA;Creating Ordering new VSIs is accomplished through [[SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest::createObject]]. First, a SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest template object is created that contains the details of the VSI.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Error Fetching http headers&amp;quot; is a common error to encounter when working with the SLAPI. Fortunately, it is not terribly difficult to avoid. This error most commonly met when working with a large sets of data and can be a bit cryptic, as it seems to imply some sort of connection issue. In truth, it is a client side error provided when a timeout occurs while waiting for a response from the API.</description>

Our ordering system is a prime example. With it you are able to not only choose the standard assortment of specifications for a cloud server, but also if you want your storage stored locally vs on a SAN or even how you want us to contact you if there is an issue with a particular CCI.</description>

When I had originally developed this project, I built my thumbnail generator with the intent of adding caching support to it in order to reduce the strain placed on the server during peak usage. Unfortunately, I had forgotten to add the caching support and the product went live without.&#xA;When this product was launched, the initial traffic spurt was about 110 users all at the same time.</description>

      <description>When ordering a CCI on our shopping cart you are currently unable to specify a VLAN. While there are exceptions in place for things like VLAN-bound firewalls and load balancers, there are a number of situations outside of those in which a shared VLAN is preferable. Good news - when placing an order via the API this is something that can be accomplished!&#xA;When populating the virtualGuests property of a SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_Virtual_Guest you need to create an array of SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when putting together a script for the API I find myself wanting to remove as much complication from the process as possible. Maybe in need of troubleshooting simplicity to rule out the plethora of idiosyncrasies which may be causing an API call to fail, or possibly just the need to walk my way through an idea and worry about the logic later.&#xA;I’m sure we all have our own process to filter out all of the complications the technologies we use may cause; for me in the case of the SLAPI I fall back to a Bash shell, curl and our REST endpoint.</description>

While the benefits utilizing a geographically diverse and scalable DNS architecture merit a post dedicated to them, it is the implementation of this feature which has caught my attention.&#xA;Simply providing a SLAPI user with DNS management permissions and its associated SLAPI key allows cPanel to seamlessly integrate interaction with the SoftLayer DNS infrastructure.</description>

There are many tools and ideas which can help greatly in this area, however, sometimes very small behavioral changes can result in a cumulative win. When working on web-based projects in PHP, I often find that I need to see what’s contained in an array or an object so I can get my code just right.</description>

      <description>Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is built on server-to-server remote procedure calls over HTTP. The data is formatted as XML; this means secure, well formatted data will be sent and received from SoftLayer’s API. This may take a little more time to set up than the REST API but it can be more scalable as you programmatically interface with it. SOAP’s ability to tunnel through existing protocols such as HTTP and innate ability to work in an object-oriented structure make it an excellent choice for interaction with the SoftLayer API.</description>

This new construct has been carried to the iOS platform starting with iOS 4.0. Developers familiar with the venerable LISP will smile knowingly at blocks, and wonder what took that young whippersnapper C so long. Likewise, Ruby aficionados will look at blocks and find an old friend.</description>

      <description>To gadgetize or not to gadgetize? That is the question. Between Apple widgets, Google gadgets, and Windows gadgets, these technologies have a bit of buzz associated with them. But as with any technology, just because it’s cool doesn’t mean it makes sense in every situation. So when I was first approached with the idea of implementing a Windows gadget to interact with the SoftLayer Application Programming Interface (SLAPI), I stepped back and asked myself what area or areas of the SLAPI make a compelling case for gadgetization.</description>

      <description>The SoftLayer API started on the web. It was originally created to support the back end of our web portals. However, the API is an asset whose value extends beyond the web. The API is built on commonly used technologies like XML, JSON, and HTTP. As a result, it is possible to access the API from environments that are very different than that of the typical web browser. The SoftLayer Mobile Client is an excellent example.</description>

      <description>As a fan of XML, the DOM, and interesting design patterns, when recently asked for a way to retrieve a representation of a public directory tree on an iPhone app, I decided to code something a little more elegant than printing raw XML or, worse, some custom format. My first assumption was that I&#39;d be building an actual DOM tree, then outputting formatted XML from there. This way, I&#39;d be assured my output was always valid XML.</description>

      <description>When I first learned about object oriented programming, many years ago, I found that the technique fit me well. I found the process of breaking a computing problem down into objects to be a natural way to analyze many of them. At the same time, my designs are never as elegant as I would like them to be in the first draft. For me, the object oriented design process involves tinkering with the design, trying a couple of iterations, and refining the deconstruction over time.</description>

Most of the engineers around here are first rate hands at web application technologies like PHP, JavaScript, and HTML.&#xA;I don&#39;t know much HTML. I know even less PHP.</description>

      <title>A Conversation on API Abstraction</title>

      <description>As a developer, I have a good relationship with the PHP community. Many of my personal friends are involved in large PHP projects all over the world. One friend in particular is the lead developer of The Easy API. It&#39;s an API wrapper that does the &#34;hard parts&#34; for you. Some companies release &#34;APIs&#34; that are confusing hodgepodges of unrelated functionality. Many times the API in question is simply a web form that developers are expected to POST to and parse poorly-formatted output.</description>

      <description>Object Masks, Filters, and Other V3 Black Magic&#xA;Everyone has heard the age old saying for any given job you need to have the right tool. Just as most of us have tried to use the flat rounded edge of a butter knife a time or two when what we desperately needed was a screw driver. Does that mean you weren&#39;t able to open that little compartment on whatever gizmo and replace the batteries?</description>

      <description>Here at SoftLayer, we have a lot of things that we need to keep track of. It&#39;s not just payments, servers, rack slots, network ports, processors, hard drives, RAM sticks, and operating systems, it&#39;s also bandwidth, monitoring, network intrusions, firewall logs, VPN access logs, API access, user history, and a whole host more. Last year, I was tapped to completely overhaul the existing bandwidth system. The old system was starting to show its age, and with our phenomenal growth it just hasn&#39;t been able to keep up.</description>

      <title>Using CURL to access CloudLayer Storage</title>

      <description>CloudLayer Storage is billed as providing &#34;anytime, anywhere access to your data&#34;. This isn’t just referring to human interfaces, but also includes automated interfaces.&#xA;One easy way to automate access to CloudLayer Storage is through curl. Curl is available as a command-line tool in most every operating system and is typically used for transferring files. In this post I’ll show some examples on how to use curl to add, get, delete, or otherwise manipulate files in CloudLayer Storage.</description>

      <title>PHP Memory Management in Foreach</title>
      <link>https://sldn.softlayer.com/blog/dmcaloon/php-memory-management-foreach/</link>

      <guid>https://sldn.softlayer.com/blog/dmcaloon/php-memory-management-foreach/</guid>
      <description>Many developers, even experienced ones, are confused by the way PHP handles arrays in foreach loops. In the standard foreach loop, PHP makes a copy of the array that is used in the loop. The copy is discarded immediately after the loop finishes. This is transparent in the operation of a simple foreach loop. For example:&#xA;$set = array&amp;#40;&#34;apple&#34;, &#34;banana&#34;, &#34;coconut&#34;&amp;#41;; foreach &amp;#40; $set AS $item &amp;#41; &amp;#123; echo &#34;{$item}\ &#34;</description>

      <description>There has been some discussion recently among our dev team regarding PHP type conversion. I’ll give some of the problems we’ve run into and then try to shed some light on the inner workings of PHP when it does comparisons.&#xA;The first example may seem familiar to most seasoned developers, but when chained together it brings up an interesting point about PHP: The = = operator isn’t transitive. echo &amp;#40;null = = 0 ?</description>

      <description>On August 26, our CTO Nathan Day wrote a post on the InnerLayer blog about nameservers. His straightforward explanation of nameservers and their operations got me thinking about how NOT straightforward the whole operation is. The way Nathan explained it, you type in “theinnerlayer.softlayer.com” and it is translated to an IP address, which is then contacted, and the page is returned to you. However, if you know the IP address already, you can use that instead of the URL, and skip the nameserver entirely.</description>

      <description>Most SL customers host websites on our services, and all websites benefit from high search engine rankings. The &#34;old method&#34; of search engine optimization doesn&#39;t really work anymore. Back in the days before Google, the best way to get to the top of the search engine rankings was to follow four easy steps:&#xA;Diversify your IP space. Add keywords to the tag on your site. Make sure those keywords also appear in the body of your document.</description>

      <description>(This post refers to SoftLayer API version 1. Check out API version 3 for our latest updates.)&#xA;We&#39;ve added a new feature to the&#xA;Softlayer API: getIPaddressDetails. For a given IP address, this method will retrieve the parent subnet, VLAN identifier, IP address which it is routed to and the name of the server it&#39;s routed to. Instead of using the customer portal and typing in a slew of IP addresses one by one into the public network ip search page, simply call this IP for each IP address, saving you time and typing.</description>

For the uninitiated, backbone graphs show the network usage between the SoftLayer datacenter and the Internet. This functionality was accomplished by adding two new methods to the SoftLayer API.&#xA;getBackboneList&#xA;Retrieves an array of id and name pairs for all SoftLayer&#39;s Backbone providers</description>

      <description>Welcome to the SoftLayer Developer Network!&#xA;SoftLayer has been a leader in giving our customers control over their dedicated server environment through our customer portal. Now we are pushing the envelope and exposing that same level of functionality to our customers through an API. To help you we have created this community - The SoftLayer Developer Network.&#xA;Just think of what you could do with an API to the datacenter. You could integrate the API into your custom application, you could write a plug-in to your favorite third party app, you could integrate dedicated server command and control into your corporate intranet, or you could even create your own version of the SoftLayer portal.</description>

      <description>Everyone at SoftLayer is excited about the API. But we can&#39;t wait to see what our customers are going to be doing with it. You can go to the implementations page to see some examples of ways to use the API. What we would really like to put on that page is a list of applications developed by our customers. If you create a use for the API that is new and unique, or if you just want to show the world how cool you are - send us an email at sldn@softlayer.</description>
