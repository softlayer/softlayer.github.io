      <description># Code example of how to list virtual instances from a SoftLayer account. # You can call the script from the command and provide the username you # want to filter on. The script expects that you have the SoftLayer gem # installed and have it configured with the credentials you&amp;#39;d like # to use with SoftLayer. # See https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-ruby/blob/master/lib/softlayer/Config.rb#L11-L44. # # You can run the script with the username you&amp;#39;d like to check under # the account you have configured: # find_my_active_vms userid # # The output of the script is in a csv format with commas as the # column separator.</description>
