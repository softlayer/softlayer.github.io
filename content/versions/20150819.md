#### Portal 
* Removed private IP address detection that checks whether or not the IP address starts with "10.". This comes necessary now that we support Customer Defined Networks.
* Correctly identify if the primary ip address is in the private ip space, instead of relying on the "10." prefix in the ip address.
* Updates the order review page to always show transfer/floor pricing.
* Resolve issues with discrepancy in mandatory fields in add portal user across portals.

#### API
* Fix an error occurring when fetching the receipt during ordering from a quote.
