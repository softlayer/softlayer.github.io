#### Portal
+ Fixed a minor display issue with the data transfer service

#### API
+ Fixed a bug with location-based pricing and capacity restrictions. This ensures that you can continue to submit standard pricing to the API endpoints, and the back-end will automatically use the right location based prices when ordering.
