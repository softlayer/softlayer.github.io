#### Portal
+ Correcting ability for Agents to Escalate a Ticket to SoftLayer Sales Group
+ Fixed a minor storage view error
+ The validator was previous incorrectly kicking out firewall orders for servers which have the private VLAN as an inside VLAN but not the public VLAN. This has been fixed and the validator should now allow those orders to go through.

#### API
+ [SoftLayer_Account.nextInvoiceIncubatorExemptTotal](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Account) is now depreciated and will be removed in a later version
+ Numbers are no longer valid characters for a lastName field when creating an account.
